Image to text conversion

Hi everyone....
here i have given the code for image to text conversion.
Here i have chosen a text embedded image, which will convert to text that is contained in the image as output.
Make sure that the text embedded image has single background color, as this code won't be fit in to some images which has multicoloured background.
